to apply database back up run these commands in terminal:

STEP 1: go to directory /scripts
STEP 2: run command: ./drop_create_db.sh
STEP 3: run command: ./restore_data.sh <path/to/backup/backup.dump>


Note: In the directory structure we can run step 3: ./restore_data.sh ../backup/<backup.dump>
* replace <backup.dump> with the backup file
