How to setup auto back up every day 2:00 am


STEP 1. Open the crontab editor with the command:

crontab -e



STEP 2. Add a new line to schedule your backup script. For example, to run the backup script every day at 2:00 AM, you can add the following line:

0 2 * * * /path/to/your/backup_script.sh



Make sure to replace /path/to/your/backup_script.sh with the actual path to your backup script.
The format for the cron job is as follows:

minute hour day month day_of_week command

In the example above:

0 for the minute field means the script will run at the beginning of the hour.
2 for the hour field means the script will run at 2:00 AM.
* for the day, month, and day_of_week fields means every day.



STEP 3. Save the file and exit the editor.
This cron job will execute your backup script every day at the specified time. Adjust the timing according to your preferences.



Note: If you want to disable auto backup just comment the line of code using #
run command: crontab -e




for testing you can set auto back up for every minute to check if it's working. Don't forget to comment it if you are done testing: 

* * * * * /path/to/your/backup_script.sh
